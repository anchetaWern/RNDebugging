# RNDebugging

A sample React Native app showing how to debug with Reactotron and React Native Debugger.

The full tutorial is available at: [https://blog.pusher.com/react-native-debugging/](https://blog.pusher.com/react-native-debugging/)

This branch contains the broken project which is to be debugged. The `master` branch contains the fixed code with additional code for connecting 
to Reactotron and React Native Debugger.

_Note: the React Native code in this repo may be a little bit outdated and won't run immediately after you've followed the setup instructions. Be sure to refactor the code to use the more recent React Native syntax if it doesn't run for you._
